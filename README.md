# Content Crawler Migration 

This Drupal 8 module migrates the web page content and media files into a clean GovCMS instance. This module
expects a json input as its source. We use a third-party plugin to crawl through the site we need to migrate and generate the json source.  

Download and install `Content Crawler` by [Jeremy Graham](https://jez.me) :
 - https://github.com/jez500/content-crawler 


## Dependencies 

The doghouse content migration module depends on [migrate_plus](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_plus) and [migrate_tools](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_plus) Drupal 8 modules. So please
note that when you enable this module, it will also enable those two dependent modules. 

## Installation

Create the json source by running the content-crawler and place it somewhere in your `public://` directory
and change the location here on the migration .yml file.

```
  urls:
      - 'public://path-to-file/<filename>.json'      
```

If you have a CSV instead of a json source, you will also need to change here:
 
 
```
  data_fetcher_plugin: file
  data_parser_plugin: csv
```

Download the Drupal module to your `docroot/modules/custom` directory
Enable the module and its dependencies:

```
drush en content_crawler_migration
``` 

## Usage

List all the migrations available:
```
drush migrate-status
```

Execute individual import:
```
drush migrate:import <migration-name>
```

Or you can execute the group and it will execute all the migrations under that:

```
drush migrate:import --group=<group-name>
```

Check your vanilla GovCMS installation for the migrated content.

## Debugging/Testing and Troubleshooting

[Migrate devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_devel) module can be useful for dumping out verbose source and destination info in the terminal.


If you don't have [Config devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_devel) installed and configured,
you might need to uninstall and reinstall the `doghouse_content_migrate` module every time you make a change to the .yml.

Install the config devel module and add this code snippet to the module info file:

```
# To re-import below migrations/configs run `drush cdi content_crawler_migration`
config_devel:
  install:
  - migrate_plus.migration.pages
  - migrate_plus.migration.images
  - migrate_plus.migration.files
  - migrate_plus.migration_group.json_import
```  
Then simply add execute this Drush command to re-import the configs:

```
drush cdi content_crawler_migration
``` 

 
If you want to rollback your migration:
```
drush migrate-rollback <migration-name>
```

If you ever get your migration conflicted/jammed run this, it will change the migration status back to Idle.

```
drush migrate-reset-status <migration-name>
```
